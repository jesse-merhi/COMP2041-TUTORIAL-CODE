Lab Tips:
    Get you using the shell in a more typical way that you would use in real situations.
    The orange questions have NO auto marking. Ask a friend to use your program! 
    See if they can mess with it. Make it behave incorrectly. Do some testing!
Ex1. 
    Straight forward
Ex2. 
    The "display command" will not work on SSH, you need to use VNC or the lab computer.
    Look into the usage of "read" in shell, it might be useful
Ex3.
    Involves creating text on an image. If you modify the same image several times
    the text will likely overlap.
    Your program should not modify the last modified date of the image. 
    (Look into how you can change the modify date of a file)
Ex4. 
Shouldn't include anything completely new. You need to use ID3 -> Look into the usage of this. (manual)
